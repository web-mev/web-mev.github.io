About file names Note that we try to be flexible about how files are named, but we generally advocate for \"simple\" names without spaces and/or special characters other than dashes (\"-\") or underscores (\"_\"). Special characters can cause unexpected issues when attempting to read files and/or use them for analyses. To be clear, we permit files to have spaces within their names, but we ultimately convert the names within WebMeV to avoid any downstream problems. So do not be surprised if you see that your uploaded file has a slightly different name in the file manager. Some pitfalls to avoid: - Avoid files that start with numbers or other characters (e.g. \"2A.tsv\"). We will reject those outright. File \"types\" and extensions To run analysis operations, we need to be able to parse the input files. To do that in a predictable and reproducible way, we need to know what types of files we are dealing with. Each analysis type expects files in a particular format and we can better control for errors if we assign \"types\" to each file and validate their format before attempting to use them in any analyses. After uploading your file(s), the file manager will prompt you to select the file type. Upon selection, WebMeV will attempt to parse and validate your file to confirm that it can be used for downstream analyses. The file manager page has a guide to help understand each file type and what they mean, but you can also see these types here . It is not feasible to validate large sequencing files, so certain file types bypass any pre-validation. The file extension (e.g. \"tsv\" in \"myFile.tsv\") serves as a clue for the format of the data and how we attempt to parse it. We note that a file's format is different than its \"type\"; whereas the \"type\" refers to what it represents (e.g. an expression matrix, a BED file, etc.), the file's format refers to how the data is stored. An example is the extension of \"csv\" ( myFile.csv ), which signals that each column is separated/delimited with a comma. There is no \"official\" guide to this, but we follow conventional nomenclature. See here for a list of the formats/extensions we support. If the format does not match the extension (e.g. a tab-delimited file named as \"myFile.csv\"), this will often result in parsing errors and warnings, but this is not always the case. Thus, it is important that you preview your files (if available) in WebMeV to see that they have been interpreted correctly. Finally, we make note that some common bioinformatics file types implicitly enforce a particular format and extension. An example is a BED-format file. These are required to be saved in a tab-delimited format and we further require that the file extension is set to \"bed\" (e.g. myBedFile.bed). Again, these formats are simply conventions to simplify bioinformatics workflows and communication, but we strictly enforce this within WebMeV. Note that we attempt to provide useful instructions if your file does not validate, but we cannot anticipate the many things that can go wrong in formatting files. If you believe there is an error, please let us know! Previewing files To check that your file was uploaded and parsed correctly, you can click on the \"preview\" icon (the eyeball) to see a portion of your file. If, for instance, your count matrix does not appear as a \"sensible\" looking table of numbers, then this is a clue that something has gone wrong. Generally, plain-text files are best, but we also accept Excel files. Note, however, that auto-formatting within Excel has been implicated in many errors in the bioinformatics field (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80) Removing files To preserve the fidelity of your workspace, we do not allow you to delete files which are part of a workspace. To fully delete a file, you must first remove it from all workspaces. A list of the current workspaces is provided in the file manager table. One important caveat of all this is that you cannot delete a file which has been used for an analysis . This includes inputs and outputs of analyses. For example, if you used a file containing differential expression results to execute a GSEA pathway analysis, you can't remove that input file. To do so would \"break\" your analysis flow since we would no longer have any record of a file required to fully recreate your analysis workflow. Hence, you can only delete files which have not been used in any workspaces and further are not attached to any workspaces. Renaming files By default, many analyses will name your files automatically. If you wish to simplify these names, you may rename them in the file manager/editor. It is up to you to keep these names distinct and memorable. The analyses track these files by unique identifiers, so the human-assigned name is primarily used as a cue for the user. Note that the file extension (e.g. \"tsv\" in \"myfile.tsv\") is often used as a \"clue\" for how to parse the file. Changing that extension can lead to unexpected behavior, so we advise against altering the extension. Generally, we try to catch these sorts of errors, but it is a challenge to anticipate the many things that can go wrong.","title":"Managing files"},{"location":"file_management/#file-management-in-webmev","text":"","title":"File management in WebMeV"},{"location":"file_management/#file-uploads","text":"To upload your data...

For more details, see the corresponding pages in the side menu. Login To better understand WebMeV usage and provide better security, we require that users register with WebMeV. You can do this using either your own email address or by using a Google account. If you register via email, we will send you a link to validate your account. Uploading files To run an analysis, you obviously need to have data to work with. You may either upload data from your local machine or by using our Dropbox uploader (Fig 1.) If available, you can also create data from a number of public data sources we provide. Assigning file \"types\" We need to know what types of files we are dealing with. Each analysis type expects files in a particular format and we can better control for errors if we assign \"types\" to each file and validate their format before using them in any analyses. After uploading your file(s), the file manager will prompt you to select the file type.

Note that we attempt to provide useful instructions if your file does not validate, but we cannot anticipate the many things that can go wrong in formatting files. If you believe there is an error, please let us know! Creating a workspace To help with managing and organizing multiple types of analyses, we allow users to create \"workspaces\". All your analysis is performed within the context of a workspace. While you are not required to use more than one workspace, we encourage users to separate different types of analyses if they concern fundamentally different data. For example, one workspace might contain analyses related to an RNA-seq experiment performed on a cell-line while another workspace might contain analyses pertaining to an unrelated patient-derived xenograft mouse experiment. Adding data to your workspace Workspaces are initially empty. You can then \"import\" files to one or more workspaces to use in analysis. Even if you have uploaded all your files, you cannot use them until they have been validated and added to your workspace. Running analyses Under the \"tools\" tab, you will find a list of available analyses grouped by their general \"type\". For instance, the differential expression menu contains several common packages for performing a differential expression analysis. Common pitfall- no options for a given input Each analysis input is restricted to an expected type and the available options are based on that expectation. For example, if we are attempting to run a differential expression analysis, one required input is a \"count matrix\" (also called an expression matrix). Accordingly, the options for such an input will be populated with a list of files in your workspace which have a \"file type\" appropriate for this input. If you do not see any input options for a given field, you likely have to perform another action first. For instance, to execute a pathway analysis (e.g. GSEA), you first need an ordered list of genes (typically ranked by a measure of their differential expression). If you attempt to run a GSEA analysis right away, you will most likely notice that the dropdown menu for the input file is empty. Hence, you either need to first upload a file with the proper format or (most likely) run a differential expression analysis first. Similarly, some analyses (such as differential expression analysis) require you to provide two groups of samples/observations to compare. Therefore, you must first create these two groups, either through a clustering analysis or by annotating your samples (e.g. telling WebMeV which samples are \"experimental\" and which should be considered as a \"control\" group). Viewing results After requesting an analysis, your job will be queued and executed in a (hopefully!) timely manner. Depending on the size of your dataset and the requested analysis, this can be relatively quick (e.g. under 10 seconds) or take significantly longer (minutes, hours). WebMeV will periodically check the state of your job and report back with the status (i.e. running, finishing, preparing visualization). Unfortunately, we cannot provide fine-grained details on the progress (such as \"75% complete\"). Once the job is complete, you can view the results by finding your \"executed analysis\" in the results menu. Most result pages will provide interactive visualizations or plots that will allow you to define interesting groups of samples, genes, and perform other actions. Most figures can be exported for download.","title":"Quickstart"},{"location":"quickstart/#webmev-quickstart-guide","text":"This quickstart is not meant to be comprehensive, but simply to provide a brief introduction for those who would like to get started as soon as possible.
