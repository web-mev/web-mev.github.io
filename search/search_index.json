Local uploads are best for smaller files like prepared count matrices or other files smaller than 500MB. If you attempt to upload files larger than our limit (which may change), the upload will be prevented with a warning message. If you are trying to load sequence data (which can be multiple GB), we only allow uploads via Dropbox. This prevents many large uploads from consuming bandwidth on the WebMeV server. About file names Note that we try to be flexible about how files are named, but we generally advocate for \"simple\" names without spaces and/or special characters other than dashes (\"-\") or underscores (\"_\"). Special characters can cause unexpected issues when attempting to read files and/or use them for analyses. To be clear, we permit files to have spaces within their names, but we ultimately convert the names within WebMeV to avoid any downstream problems. So do not be surprised if you see that your uploaded file has a slightly different name in the file manager. Some pitfalls to avoid: - Avoid files that start with numbers or other characters (e.g. \"2A.tsv\"). We will reject those outright. File \"types\" and extensions To run analysis operations, we need to be able to parse the input files. To do that in a predictable and reproducible way, we need to know what types of files we are dealing with. Each analysis type expects files in a particular format and we can better control for errors if we assign \"types\" to each file and validate their format before attempting to use them in any analyses. After uploading your file(s), the file manager will prompt you to select the file type. Upon selection, WebMeV will attempt to parse and validate your file to confirm that it can be used for downstream analyses. The file manager page has a guide to help understand each file type and what they mean, but you can also see these types here . It is not feasible to validate large sequencing files, so certain file types bypass any pre-validation. The file extension (e.g. \"tsv\" in \"myFile.tsv\") serves as a clue for the format of the data and how we attempt to parse it. We note that a file's format is different than its \"type\"; whereas the \"type\" refers to what it represents (e.g. an expression matrix, a BED file, etc.), the file's format refers to how the data is stored. An example is the extension of \"csv\" ( myFile.csv ), which signals that each column is separated/delimited with a comma. There is no \"official\" guide to this, but we follow conventional nomenclature. See here for a list of the formats/extensions we support. If the format does not match the extension (e.g. a tab-delimited file named as \"myFile.csv\"), this will often result in parsing errors and warnings, but this is not always the case. Thus, it is important that you preview your files (if available) in WebMeV to see that they have been interpreted correctly. Finally, we make note that some common bioinformatics file types implicitly enforce a particular format and extension. An example is a BED-format file. These are required to be saved in a tab-delimited format and we further require that the file extension is set to \"bed\" (e.g. myBedFile.bed). Again, these formats are simply conventions to simplify bioinformatics workflows and communication, but we strictly enforce this within WebMeV. Note that we attempt to provide useful instructions if your file does not validate, but we cannot anticipate the many things that can go wrong in formatting files. If you believe there is an error, please let us know! Previewing files To check that your file was uploaded and parsed correctly, you can click on the \"preview\" icon (the eyeball) to see a portion of your file. If, for instance, your count matrix does not appear as a \"sensible\" looking table of numbers, then this is a clue that something has gone wrong. Generally, plain-text files are best, but we also accept Excel files. Note, however, that auto-formatting within Excel has been implicated in many errors in the bioinformatics field (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80) Removing files To preserve the fidelity of your workspace, we do not allow you to delete files which are part of a workspace. To fully delete a file, you must first remove it from all workspaces. A list of the current workspaces is provided in the file manager table. One important caveat of all this is that you cannot delete a file which has been used for an analysis . This includes inputs and outputs of analyses. For example, if you used a file containing differential expression results to execute a GSEA pathway analysis, you can't remove that input file. To do so would \"break\" your analysis flow since we would no longer have any record of a file required to fully recreate your analysis workflow. Hence, you can only delete files which have not been used in any workspaces and further are not attached to any workspaces. Renaming files By default, many analyses will name your files automatically. If you wish to simplify these names, you may rename them in the file manager/editor. It is up to you to keep these names distinct and memorable. The analyses track these files by unique identifiers, so the human-assigned name is primarily used as a cue for the user. Note that the file extension (e.g. \"tsv\" in \"myfile.tsv\") is often used as a \"clue\" for how to parse the file. Changing that extension can lead to unexpected behavior, so we advise against altering the extension. Generally, we try to catch these sorts of errors, but it is a challenge to anticipate the many things that can go wrong.","title":"Managing files"},{"location":"file_management/#file-management-in-webmev","text":"","title":"File management in WebMeV"},{"location":"file_management/#file-uploads","text":"To upload your data, you can choose to upload data from your local machine or from Dropbox.

You can do this using either your own email address or by using a Google account. If you register via email, we will send you a link to validate your account. Uploading files To run an analysis, you obviously need to have data to work with. You may either upload data from your local machine or by using our Dropbox uploader (Fig 1.) If available, you can also create data from a number of public data sources we provide. Assigning file \"types\" We need to know what types of files we are dealing with. Each analysis type expects files in a particular format and we can better control for errors if we assign \"types\" to each file and validate their format before using them in any analyses. After uploading your file(s), the file manager will prompt you to select the file type. Upon selection, WebMeV will attempt to parse and validate your file to confirm that it can be used for downstream analyses.

Note that we attempt to provide useful instructions if your file does not validate, but we cannot anticipate the many things that can go wrong in formatting files. If you believe there is an error, please let us know! Creating a workspace To help with managing and organizing multiple types of analyses, we allow users to create \"workspaces\". All your analysis is performed within the context of a workspace. While you are not required to use more than one workspace, we encourage users to separate different types of analyses if they concern fundamentally different data. For example, one workspace might contain analyses related to an RNA-seq experiment performed on a cell-line while another workspace might contain analyses pertaining to an unrelated patient-derived xenograft mouse experiment. Adding data to your workspace Workspaces are initially empty. You can then \"import\" files to one or more workspaces to use in analysis. Even if you have uploaded all your files, you cannot use them until they have been validated and added to your workspace. Running analyses Under the \"tools\" tab, you will find a list of available analyses grouped by their general \"type\". For instance, the differential expression menu contains several common packages for performing a differential expression analysis. Common pitfall- no options for a given input Each analysis input is restricted to an expected type and the available options are based on that expectation. For example, if we are attempting to run a differential expression analysis, one required input is a \"count matrix\" (also called an expression matrix). Accordingly, the options for such an input will be populated with a list of files in your workspace which have a \"file type\" appropriate for this input. If you do not see any input options for a given field, you likely have to perform another action first. For instance, to execute a pathway analysis (e.g. GSEA), you first need an ordered list of genes (typically ranked by a measure of their differential expression). If you attempt to run a GSEA analysis right away, you will most likely notice that the dropdown menu for the input file is empty. Hence, you either need to first upload a file with the proper format or (most likely) run a differential expression analysis first. Similarly, some analyses (such as differential expression analysis) require you to provide two groups of samples/observations to compare. Therefore, you must first create these two groups, either through a clustering analysis or by annotating your samples (e.g. telling WebMeV which samples are \"experimental\" and which should be considered as a \"control\" group). Viewing results After requesting an analysis, your job will be queued and executed in a (hopefully!) timely manner. Depending on the size of your dataset and the requested analysis, this can be relatively quick (e.g. under 10 seconds) or take significantly longer (minutes, hours). WebMeV will periodically check the state of your job and report back with the status (i.e. running, finishing, preparing visualization). Unfortunately, we cannot provide fine-grained details on the progress (such as \"75% complete\"). Once the job is complete, you can view the results by finding your \"executed analysis\" in the results menu. Most result pages will provide interactive visualizations or plots that will allow you to define interesting groups of samples, genes, and perform other actions. Most figures can be exported for download.","title":"Quickstart"},{"location":"quickstart/#webmev-quickstart-guide","text":"This quickstart is not meant to be comprehensive, but simply to provide a brief introduction for those who would like to get started as soon as possible.

Here we show the upload of the RNA-seq counts file, which looks like: Sample_A Sample_B ... Sample_T geneA 2 5 ... 54 geneB 101 102 ... 8 ... 56 51 ... 56 In addition to the prepared RNA-seq counts, we also have an \"annotation file\". This file gives sample metadata, or data about the samples themselves . In our example, the annotation file tells us that some of the samples were derived from cultures of monocytes while others came from CD4 cells. Additionally, it lists the sequencing \"batch\". We don't use that in this walkthrough, but one could use that variable to assess if there were any noticeable batch effects that we should adjust for. sample_id cell_type sequencing_run sample_D Monocytes run1 sample_C Monocytes run1 sample_S CD4 run1 ... ... ... sampleT CD4 run1 Defining file types After upload, we need to tell WebMeV what types of files these are. Note that the file name shows up in red text to alert us about this. We choose \"RNA-seq count matrix\" and \"Annotation file\" After setting the file types, WebMeV will attempt to parse and validate. If successful, you will see that the files are \"active\" without any warnings. As a double-check, we click on the \"eyeball\" icon to view a preview. Everything looks good. Generally, if something was incorrectly formatted, then the file will not pass validation. Creating a new workspace Now that the files are uploaded and ready, we switch to the \"workspaces\" tab. Initially this is empty. Clicking the button opens a dialog where we enter the name of the workspace. Choose a simple, descriptive name (\"mev-demo\" in this case). Then click on the link to enter this new workspace Adding data to the workspace After creating the workspace and clicking on the link, the workspace view is opened. Initially the workspace is empty. Note the empty table in the file browser. Your uploaded files still exist, but the table is empty since they have not been added to this particular workspace. Clicking on the \"add local data\" from above, we can select which files we want to import into this workspace. Running analyses Navigate to the \"tools\" tab and look at the list of options for analysis tools. Below, we show how to initiate a principal component analysis (PCA). Next to each input field, the question mark icon will provide help and explanation for that analysis input. For a PCA analysis, we only require the input RNA-seq count matrix. There is also an optional input for executing the PCA on a subset of samples, but we leave that blank. As mentioned in the how-to guide, inputs that correspond to input files will be populated with all available files that match the expected type. Sometimes the input does not make sense for a given analysis, so the presence of a particular file as an input option does not mean that it is necessarily appropriate for that analysis . After filling everything out, we click \"Run\" and wait... Exploring the PCA output After the PCA completes, the interface will update to show the PCA projection plot. This is a \"simplified\" 2-dimensional representation of your data. Typically, samples with similar expression profiles or phenotypes will cluster together. Each data point represents a single sample. From the plot, we can see two general clusters- one on the left side of the plot and the other on the right. Since WebMeV is interactive, we can now use this PCA clustering to begin investigating these samples. We click the \"select points\" button (shown in light blue) to toggle the \"drag and draw\" functionality. With this, we are able to select the points in each cluster. Below, we show only a single cluster, but we do this for both the left and right clusters. Note that when the samples are selected, you are told that you have selected \"sample_A\", \"sample_B\", and so on. We then click the \"Save as a sample set\" button, which opens up a popup dialog (see below). That popup allows us to define a custom \"observation set\" and choose a color to represent that group of samples. Note that in WebMeV's terminology an \"observation\" is a sample and a \"feature\" is a gene. We use those more general terms to avoid confusion in situations where the data does not correspond to biological samples or specifically genes. We do this for both clusters and name them \"setA\" and \"setB\". If you navigate to the \"metadata\" tab, you can see that the table now shows both of these: You may now click on one of the set to see the samples corresponding to the set. Incorporating annotations Recall that due to the sequencing experiment, we had prior knowledge of each cell type (monocytes, CD4). Given what we are dealing with two distinct cell types, we might expect that the two clusters we identified in the PCA directly correspond with these. If you go to the \"metadata\" tab and click on the \"incorporate annotations\" file, you will be presented with a popup where you may select from any annotation files that you have in your workspace. If you have not uploaded and set any files of this type, then this option will not be enabled. In our annotation file, we had two colums named \"cell_type\" and \"sequencing_run\". For the moment, we select \"cell_type\" as the annotation attribute since we are interested in how the PCA clusters correspond to the biological annotations. We can then choose to incoporate the information from this column. We select all to bring in all the information about cell types. After clicking \"add\" above, we now see that two new \"observation sets\" were created-- one for the monocytes and one for the CD4 cells, each with 10 samples in each. If we now select the \"visualization\" view to the top-right of the table, we can see a graphic representation of how the samples fall into the various groups. We immediately see that the samples in setA are almost equivalent to the samples annotated as monocytes. However , we see that \"sample_F\" does not seem to agree. Perhaps there was an error in your annotation file?? According to the PCA, sample_F showed an expression pattern more similar to your CD4 samples since it clustered with the other samples which all matched the CD4 annotation. Note that errors in annotations are more common than you think and it is important to do this type of investigation/QC. In public datasets, running a PCA using chrX/chrY expression can sometimes reveal expression patterns that are incongruous with the clinical annotation for sex. Running a differential expression analysis We next run a differential expression analysis using R/Bioconductor's DESeq2 software. The inputs to this analysis include the count matrix (same as with the PCA), but we also have options for defining the names of the contrasted groups and which samples we should contrast. Note that had you attempted to do this analysis before PCA or without first incorporating your CD4/monocytes annotations, you would not be able to execute the differential expression analysis; the dropdown input field for these inputs would be blank. This is because a differential expression analysis requires you to compare two observation sets (groups of samples). When we first started, we did not have this information so this would not be possible. Note that we have several options for our contrast groups. We could either choose to compare the groups that came from the PCA (setA, setB) or we could choose to compare the CD4 and monocyte annotations. We choose to contrast CD4 and monocytes below. Note that there is no logic that would prevent one from contrasting setB and monocytes, which would be comparing two sets of samples that are effectively the same. However, upon starting the analysis, the software would identify that the samples overlap and subsequently fail/stop the analysis. The output from the DESeq2 differential gene expression is presented as a table and boxplot. In the screenshot below, the boxplot is out of the viewing frame. However, by filtering the table, we can control which genes are shown in the boxplot directly below. By setting thresholds for the fold-change and adjusted p-value, we can filter the table down to a set of genes which show the strongest evidence for differential expression. If the size of the remaining genes is small enough (less than 500 genes, which may change), a button will activate which will allow you to define a custom \"feature set\". Below, we call this set \"topDGE\" to represent the \"top\" differentially expressed genes. Note that we set the filters to select genes with a very low adjusted p-value and a log fold-change less than 6 (which gives very strongly downregulated genes when comparing CD4 to monocytes) If you go to the metadata tab, you will see this new gene/feature set shown in the table. Plot an expression heatmap At this point, we have a list of our top differentially expressed genes. Perhaps we are interested in making a heatmap of these genes. We then head to the \"Plotting\" tab in the workspace and select \"expression heatmap\". For the expression data source, we choose the \"normalized\" expression that was one of the outputs of the differential expression analysis. We then choose \"topDGE\" as the genes/features to plot. After playing with some of the plotting parameters, we arrive at a reasonable heatmap. Note the relatively dark strip corresponding to \"sample_F\". As we suspected, this expression pattern matches much better with the monocytes, adding further evidence that the annotation file contained an error. Gene-set enrichment analysis Now, given that we have run a differential expression, we can dig further and start to look at potential biological mechanisms underpinning this data. We now run a gene-set enrichment analysis as implemented in the R/Bioconductor fGSEA package. One of the inputs to fGSEA is a table that allows the software to rank the genes. Typically, this is done as a combination of the log-fold change and p-value of differential expression. In principle, one could upload a file with this information directly, but most often we plug the output of the differential expression analysis into fGSEA. The output of the analysis is a table of the top pathways that may be affected the differentially expressed genes we previously identified. The details of fGSEA are outside the scope of this tutorial, but one can think of fGSEA as taking the ranked list of genes and overlaying them onto the database of biological pathways; if many of the genes in a particular pathway are differentially expressed, then it is reasonable to expect that the pathway would be different between the two cell types. This can start to reveal the biological meaning behind the differentially expressed genes. At this point, we can now choose one of the pathways and \"export\" the genes in that pathway to its own \"feature set\". By default, the set name is given as the name of the pathway from the fGSEA database, but you are free to change that. We leave it as the default here. Feature set operations Again, if we head to the metadata tab, we can see all the observation and feature sets, including this new set based on the IL-1 signaling pathway. We also see our \"topDGE\" set which was taken from the DESeq2 differential expression analysis. Perhaps we are interested in viewing those top downregulated differentially-expressed genes that are also in the IL-1 signaling pathway. Recall that fGSEA simply looks at how the full, ranked list of genes falls within the 62 genes in this pre-defined pathway. It doesn't mean that all 62 genes are differentially expressed or how they are affected (i.e. up- or downregulated). We can find out this intersection by selecting the two gene sets and performing a feature intersection by clicking on the button to \"Create set from intersection\". This ends up creating a new set of three genes. Thus, out of the 62 genes in the IL-1 signaling pathway, only three are strongly downregulated comparing CD4 versus . Boxplot of expressions As a final step in our analysis, let's look at the expression of those three significantly downregulated genes in the IL-1 pathway. Go to the \"Plotting\" tab again and this time choose \"expression boxplot\". Again, we select the normalized expressions, but this time we choose to display the three genes in our \"intersection set\". We arrive at the boxplot shown below. Again, if you hover over the individual points, we can see sample_F with gene expressions that more closely align with CD4 cell expression. Indeed, if you choose \"setA\" and \"setB\" to segregate the expressions, we see an improvement with no \"outliers\". If it weren't obvious before, we have definitively shown that sample_F was incorrectly annotated (see the final screenshot).","title":"Case study: RNA-Seq"},{"location":"rnaseq_case_study/#case-study-rna-seq","text":"","title":"Case study: RNA-Seq"},{"location":"rnaseq_case_study/#importing-files","text":"When we initially log-in, the file browser shows that you have no files: Upload from your local machine.

This is a \"simplified\" 2-dimensional representation of your data. Typically, samples with similar expression profiles or phenotypes will cluster together. Each data point represents a single sample. From the plot, we can see two general clusters- one on the left side of the plot and the other on the right. Since WebMeV is interactive, we can now use this PCA clustering to begin investigating these samples. We click the \"select points\" button (shown in light blue) to toggle the \"drag and draw\" functionality. With this, we are able to select the points in each cluster. Below, we show only a single cluster, but we do this for both the left and right clusters. Note that when the samples are selected, you are told that you have selected \"sample_A\", \"sample_B\", and so on. We then click the \"Save as a sample set\" button, which opens up a popup dialog (see below). That popup allows us to define a custom \"observation set\" and choose a color to represent that group of samples. Note that in WebMeV's terminology an \"observation\" is a sample and a \"feature\" is a gene. We use those more general terms to avoid confusion in situations where the data does not correspond to biological samples or specifically genes. We do this for both clusters and name them \"setA\" and \"setB\". If you navigate to the \"metadata\" tab, you can see that the table now shows both of these: You may now click on one of the set to see the samples corresponding to the set.","title":"Exploring the PCA output"},{"location":"rnaseq_case_study/#incorporating-annotations","text":"Recall that due to the sequencing experiment, we had prior knowledge of each cell type (monocytes, CD4). Given what we are dealing with two distinct cell types, we might expect that the two clusters we identified in the PCA directly correspond with these. If you go to the \"metadata\" tab and click on the \"incorporate annotations\" file, you will be presented with a popup where you may select from any annotation files that you have in your workspace. If you have not uploaded and set any files of this type, then this option will not be enabled. In our annotation file, we had two colums named \"cell_type\" and \"sequencing_run\". For the moment, we select \"cell_type\" as the annotation attribute since we are interested in how the PCA clusters correspond to the biological annotations. We can then choose to incoporate the information from this column. We select all to bring in all the information about cell types. After clicking \"add\" above, we now see that two new \"observation sets\" were created-- one for the monocytes and one for the CD4 cells, each with 10 samples in each. If we now select the \"visualization\" view to the top-right of the table, we can see a graphic representation of how the samples fall into the various groups. We immediately see that the samples in setA are almost equivalent to the samples annotated as monocytes. However , we see that \"sample_F\" does not seem to agree. Perhaps there was an error in your annotation file?? According to the PCA, sample_F showed an expression pattern more similar to your CD4 samples since it clustered with the other samples which all matched the CD4 annotation. Note that errors in annotations are more common than you think and it is important to do this type of investigation/QC. In public datasets, running a PCA using chrX/chrY expression can sometimes reveal expression patterns that are incongruous with the clinical annotation for sex.","title":"Incorporating annotations"},{"location":"rnaseq_case_study/#running-a-differential-expression-analysis","text":"We next run a differential expression analysis using R/Bioconductor's DESeq2 software. The inputs to this analysis include the count matrix (same as with the PCA), but we also have options for defining the names of the contrasted groups and which samples we should contrast. Note that had you attempted to do this analysis before PCA or without first incorporating your CD4/monocytes annotations, you would not be able to execute the differential expression analysis; the dropdown input field for these inputs would be blank. This is because a differential expression analysis requires you to compare two observation sets (groups of samples). When we first started, we did not have this information so this would not be possible. Note that we have several options for our contrast groups. We could either choose to compare the groups that came from the PCA (setA, setB) or we could choose to compare the CD4 and monocyte annotations. We choose to contrast CD4 and monocytes below. Note that there is no logic that would prevent one from contrasting setB and monocytes, which would be comparing two sets of samples that are effectively the same. However, upon starting the analysis, the software would identify that the samples overlap and subsequently fail/stop the analysis. The output from the DESeq2 differential gene expression is presented as a table and boxplot. In the screenshot below, the boxplot is out of the viewing frame. However, by filtering the table, we can control which genes are shown in the boxplot directly below. By setting thresholds for the fold-change and adjusted p-value, we can filter the table down to a set of genes which show the strongest evidence for differential expression. If the size of the remaining genes is small enough (less than 500 genes, which may change), a button will activate which will allow you to define a custom \"feature set\". Below, we call this set \"topDGE\" to represent the \"top\" differentially expressed genes. Note that we set the filters to select genes with a very low adjusted p-value and a log fold-change less than 6 (which gives very strongly downregulated genes when comparing CD4 to monocytes) If you go to the metadata tab, you will see this new gene/feature set shown in the table.","title":"Running a differential expression analysis"},{"location":"rnaseq_case_study/#plot-an-expression-heatmap","text":"At this point, we have a list of our top differentially expressed genes. Perhaps we are interested in making a heatmap of these genes. We then head to the \"Plotting\" tab in the workspace and select \"expression heatmap\". For the expression data source, we choose the \"normalized\" expression that was one of the outputs of the differential expression analysis. We then choose \"topDGE\" as the genes/features to plot. After playing with some of the plotting parameters, we arrive at a reasonable heatmap. Note the relatively dark strip corresponding to \"sample_F\". As we suspected, this expression pattern matches much better with the monocytes, adding further evidence that the annotation file contained an error.","title":"Plot an expression heatmap"},{"location":"rnaseq_case_study/#gene-set-enrichment-analysis","text":"Now, given that we have run a differential expression, we can dig further and start to look at potential biological mechanisms underpinning this data. We now run a gene-set enrichment analysis as implemented in the R/Bioconductor fGSEA package. One of the inputs to fGSEA is a table that allows the software to rank the genes. Typically, this is done as a combination of the log-fold change and p-value of differential expression. In principle, one could upload a file with this information directly, but most often we plug the output of the differential expression analysis into fGSEA. The output of the analysis is a table of the top pathways that may be affected the differentially expressed genes we previously identified. The details of fGSEA are outside the scope of this tutorial, but one can think of fGSEA as taking the ranked list of genes and overlaying them onto the database of biological pathways; if many of the genes in a particular pathway are differentially expressed, then it is reasonable to expect that the pathway would be different between the two cell types. This can start to reveal the biological meaning behind the differentially expressed genes. At this point, we can now choose one of the pathways and \"export\" the genes in that pathway to its own \"feature set\". By default, the set name is given as the name of the pathway from the fGSEA database, but you are free to change that. We leave it as the default here.","title":"Gene-set enrichment analysis"},{"location":"rnaseq_case_study/#feature-set-operations","text":"Again, if we head to the metadata tab, we can see all the observation and feature sets, including this new set based on the IL-1 signaling pathway.

Recall that fGSEA simply looks at how the full, ranked list of genes falls within the 62 genes in this pre-defined pathway. It doesn't mean that all 62 genes are differentially expressed or how they are affected (i.e. up- or downregulated).
