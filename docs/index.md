# Welcome to the WebMeV User Guide

This guide is for users who are new to working with the updated WebMeV application. It is intended for bench biologists and other application users who would like to independently analyze and explore their data. Our goal with this guide is provide some basic orientation and introduce some of the terminology you may see throughout the application. Specific case-studies are provided for a typical analysis of RNA-seq data. If you have ideas or suggestions on how to improve this guide, please let us know! 

If you are interested in developing WebMeV or contributing workflows, please see the documentation specific to either the [frontend](https://github.com/web-mev/mev-frontend/) (Angular application) or [RESTful API backend](https://github.com/web-mev/mev-backend) (a Django-based application).
