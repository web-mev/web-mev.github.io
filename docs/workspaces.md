# About workspaces

To help with managing and organizing multiple types of analyses, we allow users to create "workspaces". 

All your analysis is performed within the context of a workspace. While you are not required to use more than one workspace, we encourage users to separate different types of analyses if they concern fundamentally different data. For example, one workspace might contain analyses related to an RNA-seq experiment performed on a cell-line while another workspace might contain analyses pertaining to an unrelated patient-derived xenograft mouse experiment. 

Note that a single file can be "shared" across multiple workspaces. Sincee we don't modify your files, the file content will be the same in each of the workspaces and will remain that way.
